## GET STARTED

This project uses a [task runner called just, for convenience](https://github.com/casey/just)

```
Available recipes:
    default
    install *PACKAGES
    update
    compile
    deploy-localhost
    deploy-testnet
    verify-testnet
    test
    lint
    start
    format
    audit
    print-audit
    print-gas-usage
    print-deployments
    clean
```

### Running tests and audits

- Run the unit tests with `just test`
- Statically analyse code for vulnerabilities with `just audit`
